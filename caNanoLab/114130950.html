Accurately determining the size of individual nanoparticles on a per particle basis both quickly and accurately is an ever-increasing need within nanoparticle characterization. ICPMS is capable of measuring a broad range of nanoparticle sizes with high resolution, thus allowing the measurement of multiple particle populations for the quality assessment of nanoformulations. Additionally, SP-ICP-MS can accurately determine particle concentrations without the need for concentration standards. ICP-MS is an ultrasensitive technique which can determine the concentration of trace elements in solution down to the pg/g level. Delguard et al first demonstrated in 2006 that ICPMS could accurately measure the mass of individual metallic nanoparticles in what has come to be known as SP-ICP-MS [1]. By introducing a nanoparticle solution into the ICP, the individual nanoparticles are ionized into an ion cloud which then is carried as an intact unit to the detector. After a brief rapid expansion of the ion cloud, the duration of this cloud, defined as the time it first hits the detector to the time the last ion hits, is approximately 100-650 ¬µs for 30-150 nm particles, respectively. This allows for two methods for measuring nanoparticles in SP mode, both of which will be outlined in the protocols below.<hr><p><b>Resource Type:</b>  Protocol</p><p><b>Data Access:</b> <a href =https://general.datacommons.cancer.gov/#/data>https://general.datacommons.cancer.gov/#/data</a><p></body></html>
