This technique can detect minute changes in cell populations and thus is used to characterize the cell makeup in many diseases as well as determine effects of treatments, such as nanoparticles. It is important to develop a method that allows for the immunological evaluation of nanoparticles because some nanoparticles are designed to modify the immune system while others cause immunotoxicity. Currently, the most common technique used to perform immunophenotyping is multicolor flow cytometry. NCL protocol ITA-37 covers two separate immunophenotyping panels (with 11-12 antibody-fluorophore conjugates): Immunophenotyping Panel #1 (or Lymphocyte Panel): This panel includes antibody-fluorophore conjugates that allow for analysis of different lymphocyte populations including B cells and T cells (CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells, na?Øve T cells, and Œ?Œ¥ TCR T cells). This panel also determines cellular CD25 and CD154 expression which are markers of proliferation and co-stimulation/presentation, respectively.</p><h3>File name: NCL_Method_ITA-37.1.pdf</h3><h3>DOI: <a href = http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/C7K01C>http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/C7K01C</a></h3><h3>Resource Type:  Protocol</h3><h3>Data Access: <a href =https://general.datacommons.cancer.gov/#/data>https://general.datacommons.cancer.gov/#/data</a></h3></body></html>
