This technique can detect minute changes in cell populations and thus is used to characterize the cell makeup in many diseases as well as determine effects of treatments, such as nanoparticles. It is important to develop a method that allows for immunological evaluation of nanoparticles because some nanoparticles are designed to modify the immune system while others cause immunotoxicity. Currently, the most common technique used to perform immunophenotyping is multicolor flow cytometry. NCL protocol ITA-37 covers two separate immunophenotyping panels (with 11-12 antibody-fluorophore conjugates): Immunophenotyping Panel #2 (or Monocyte, Dendritic cell (DC), Natural Killer (NK) Cell Panel): This panel includes antibody-fluorophore conjugates that allow for analysis of different cell populations including CD14+ monocytes, DCs (plasmocytoid (p) and myeloid (m) DCs), and NK cells along with NK T cells. This panel also examines cellular CD69 and CD54 expression which are markers of early activation and adhesion, respectively.</p><h3>File name: NCL_Method_ITA-37.2.pdf</h3><h3>DOI: <a href = http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/C7KW2Q >http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/C7KW2Q </a></h3<br><h3>Resource Type:  Protocol</h3><h3>Data Access: <a href =https://general.datacommons.cancer.gov/#/data>https://general.datacommons.cancer.gov/#/data</a></h3></body></html>
