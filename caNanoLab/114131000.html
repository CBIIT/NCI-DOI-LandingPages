The Œ? value is measured by dip cell calibrated with two Œ? standards.  Traceability is to the Œ? values of the respective standards.  The measurement as described may be applied to small volumes (4 mL to 5 mL) and is therefore applicable to the contents of a single ampoule of each of the above RMs.   To minimize consumption of the nanoparticle suspension, the protocol for pH measurement (see procedure PCC-13) may be performed following this measurement of Œ? of the same sample, provided that Œ? is measured according to the below protocol.  However, seepage of KCl from the reference junction of the pH electrode during the measurement of pH contaminates the sample with K+ and Cl‚àí ions, thereby increasing any Œ? value obtained subsequently.  For this reason, in a serial measurement of pH and Œ? on a single sample, the Œ? measurement must be performed first.   Nanoparticle suspensions of significantly different composition from NIST RMs 8011, 8012, and 8013 may require substitution of different Œ? standards to account for Œ? values outside the range 100 ¬µS/cm to 500 ¬µS/cm.  If such a substitution is performed, the two conductivity standards selected should bracket the value of the sample being measured.</p><h3>File name: protocols/20240410_16-48-52-904_NCL_Method_PCC-12.pdf</h3><h3>DOI: <a href = http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/9Q5G-G245>http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/9Q5G-G245</a></h3<h3>Resource Type:  Protocol</h3></body></html>
