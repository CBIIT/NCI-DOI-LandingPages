The blood is obtained from healthy donor volunteers vaccinated with the current season flu vaccine (Fluzone). The isolated cells are incubated with Fluzone in the presence or absence of nanoparticles. After a 72 hour incubation, BrdU is added to cells and the incubation continues for additional 24 hours. At the end of incubation, the cells are fixed and incorporation of BrdU into DNA of proliferating cells is analyzed by ELISA.</p><h3>File name: NCL_Method_ITA-18.pdf</h3><h3>DOI: <a href = http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/C7J012>http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/C7J012</a></h3</body></html>
