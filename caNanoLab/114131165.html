In fact, nearly one-third of formulations submitted to the NCL have levels exceeding recommended limits. However, most labs can successfully overcome this hurdle and reduce endotoxin contamination by taking a few precautionary steps during the synthesis and purification procedure. NCL has collected the attached recommendations and references to aid you in reducing endotoxin contamination. Also, consider detailing your synthetic procedure, noting every step, reagent, reaction vessel and other materials coming into contact with the sample, and handling procedure; this is often helpful to highlight steps where endotoxin can be introduced."</p><h3>File name: Endotoxin and Depyrogenation Guide.pdf</h3><h3>DOI: <a href = http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/C7PP4B >http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/C7PP4B </a></h3<h3>Resource Type:  Protocol</h3></body></html>
