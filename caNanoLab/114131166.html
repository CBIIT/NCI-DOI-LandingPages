Mast cells are myeloid-derived immune cells normally present in connective tissues, especially under the skin, around nerves, in lungs and intestines, and near blood and lymph vessels. In health, mast cells play an important role in the host‚Äôs protection from certain bacteria. Through Fce receptors expressed on the cell surface, mast cells bind antigen-specific IgE and can respond to antigens through a process known as degranulation. During degranulation, activated mast cells release secondary messengers like histamine, heparin, cytokines, growth factors, tryptase, and Œ?-hexosaminidase which activate the immune system to eliminate the antigen-bearing pathogen. When released in excessive amounts and/or when the negative regulation of mast cells is altered, the same secondary messengers underline pathological reactions such as those experienced by individuals with allergies and asthma. Mast cells can have a pro-tumorigenic or anti-tumorigenic role in cancer, depending on the type of cancer, the degree of tumor progression, and the location of the mast cells.<hr><p><b>Resource Type:</b>  Protocol</p><p><b>Data Access:</b> <a href =https://general.datacommons.cancer.gov/#/data>https://general.datacommons.cancer.gov/#/data</a><p></body></html>
