Asymmetric-flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) with various in-line detectors, such as ultraviolet‚Äìvisible (UV-Vis), multi-angle light scattering (MALS), refractive index (RI) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) is an alternative technique that can provide flow-mode analysis of not only size distribution, but also shape, drug release/stability, and protein binding.</p><h3>File name: protocols/20240410_17-20-08-842_NCL_Method_PCC-19.pdf</h3><h3>DOI: <a href = http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/8S1D-BN17 >http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/8S1D-BN17 </a></h3</body></html>
