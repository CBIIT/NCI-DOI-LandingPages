This assay uses the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 as a model. The cells are separated from control chemoattractant and test-nanoparticles by an 8 um filter. Cell migration through the filter is monitored using a label-free technology developed by ACEA Biosciences/Agilent, wherein cell attachment to gold electrodes on the underside of the filter results in a change of impedance, which subsequently is converted into a cell index which is proportional to the number of cells that migrated through the filter.</p><h3>File name: protocols/20240411_12-08-47-631_NCL_Method_ITA-8.2.pdf</h3><h3>DOI: <a href = http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/QENR-XG24>http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/QENR-XG24</a></h3</body></html>
