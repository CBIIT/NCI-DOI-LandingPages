Factors mitogenic to T-cells (e.g. PHA-M) can also induce this interferon. IFNg is essential in maintaining function of adaptive immunity through regulation of T cell function. It is also important for protection from intracellular bacteria (e.g. M.tuberculosis) and anti-tumor immunity. This document describes experimental procedure for analysis of culture supernatants by ELISA to detect presence of IFNg. NCL protocol ITA-10 should be referred to for details of preparation of culture supernatants.</p><h3>File name: protocols/20240411_13-48-46-802_NCL_Method_ITA-25.pdf</h3><h3>DOI: <a href = http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/DM9W-8430 >http://dx.doi.org/10.17917/DM9W-8430 </a></h3<h3>Resource Type:  Protocol</h3></body></html>
